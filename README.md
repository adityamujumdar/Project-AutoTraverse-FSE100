# Project-AutoTraverse---FSE100
Project AutoTraverse demonstrates the autonomous maze traversal along with pickup and dropoff for a passenger. It is equipped with a color, ultrasonic, gyro and touch sensors.  AutoTraverse was built with the LEGO Mindstorms EV3  kit and coded entirely using MATLAB. The algorithm used to traverse the maze has been designed to follow walls, traverse the maze and avoid obstacles in between.

The Manual Control part of the project includes testing design capabilites of the robot against other competitors.
The Autonomous Maze Traversal includes testing algorithm efficiency and time taken to traverse from one point to other.

The Maze Traversal was done fastest among 11 teams with a time of 1 minute 50 seconds.
